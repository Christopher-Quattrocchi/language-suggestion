# _Portfolio Project - End of Week Two_

#### _Practice Git operations, HTML, JS branching, event handlers Oct 20h 2023_

#### By _**Chris Quattrocchi**_

## Description

_End of week two recap. Practice using HTML forms, CSS, JavaScript branching to take user input and advise the user on potential programming languages they may enjoy_

_This is the second version of this project; the first version incorrectly displayed a result for each question. This updated version correctly displays one language/framework, using nested ifs_

_I may create a third version if I have time, which creates a var for each potential language, assigns them all a score of "0", and uses branching to add to the total. At the end, a different branch would output the language with the most points. I like this idea, because I could make the output make more sense. But this may be beyond the scope of the assignment._
